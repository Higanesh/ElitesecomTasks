***Shopify itself does not provide a single built-in field or flag called “confirmed order.

Here’s why:

In Shopify, an order is considered “placed” as soon as it is created successfully in the system.

After that, there are different statuses for different parts of the workflow:

financial_status – whether the payment has been captured/paid, pending, refunded, etc.

fulfillment_status – whether the order items have been shipped/fulfilled.

cancelled_at – if the order was cancelled.

But Shopify does not define “confirmed” because different businesses have different meanings for that:

Prepaid orders: Many businesses treat an order as “confirmed” only if financial_status is "paid" or "partially_paid".

COD orders: Others treat any successfully created COD order as “confirmed,” even if financial_status is "pending" or "unpaid".

Manual confirmation workflows: Some businesses call customers before dispatch and then mark the order with a custom tag or metafield like "confirmed".


***So how can you handle it?

If you want a universal “confirmed” field, you need to define your own rule. For example:

Confirmed if financial_status in ["paid", "partially_paid"]

OR (for COD) Confirmed if payment_gateway_names contains “cash on delivery” and order is not cancelled.

Or, if you need manual confirmation, you can:

Add a tag like "confirmed" via API after you confirm with the customer.

Create a custom app or automation to update a metafield/tag when confirmed.
