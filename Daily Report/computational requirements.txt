computational requirements:


🖥️ Your System

CPU: 8 cores → can support many concurrent lightweight tasks.

RAM: 32 GB → plenty, your PDFs are small (20–50 KB), so memory won’t be a limit.

Network: 200 Mbps (≈25 MB/s) → very good; the bottleneck will be the remote server or latency, not your bandwidth.


⚡ Parallelism Recommendation

Safe default: max_workers = 32

Aggressive but stable: max_workers = 64

Ceiling (test only): max_workers ≈ 100

Beyond 100: no real speedup, risk of failures (timeouts, 429 errors).


📊 Why?

Your task is I/O-bound (downloading PDFs), not CPU-heavy.

Network + server concurrency is the limiting factor, not CPU or RAM.

With 200 Mbps, you can easily saturate downloads for 1000 PDFs in parallel, but the server may throttle you.


📌 Final Answer

On 8 cores, 32 GB RAM, 200 Mbps network:
👉 You can comfortably run 32–64 parallel PDF tasks.
👉 You may push to 100 tasks if the server allows it, but more than that is wasteful.
