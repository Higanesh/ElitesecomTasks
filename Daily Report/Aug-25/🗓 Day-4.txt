Tasks Completed Today:

	1. Copy text from one place and paste it into another place in the same PDF without using coordinates.
	2. Crop PDF without using coordinates in a Python script. 
	3. Copy text from one place and paste it into another place in the same PDF using PDF blocks.
	4. I have a PDF in which blank space is there now, and I want to remove that blank space from the PDF.

What I Learned Today:

	1. By using the Fitz module, I have done some PDF operations like editing, cropping, and merging.
	2. First, I collect all block texts into one tuple, and by using indexing, I find the text that I want to copy & paste.
	3. First, I find the bottom-end text from the PDF, and by using that, I crop the blank space from the PDF.
