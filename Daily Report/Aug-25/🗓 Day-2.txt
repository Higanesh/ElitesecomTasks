Tasks Completed Today:
	
	1. Get 1000 PDFs from a URL and merge them into a single PDF.
	2. Check how much time it will take to merge 1000 PDFs after cropping each.
	3. Minimize the execution time of the script for crop & merge PDFs.

What I Learned Today:

	1. I get 1 document in which 1000 URLs are there. Now I have to call every URL one by one and download a PDF from every URL.
	2. Download every PDF from the URL and crop them one by one, and merge them into a single PDF.
	3. Minimize execution time by using concurrent.futures module and ThreadPoolExecutor class, which downloads 50 PDFs at a time, increasing performance and decreasing execution time.
