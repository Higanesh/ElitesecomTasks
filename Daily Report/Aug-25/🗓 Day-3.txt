ðŸ—“ Day-3

Tasks Completed Today:

	1. Get the label from the given URL, and after that, crop the labels' unwanted parts and save them as a new PDF.
	2. Copy text from one place and paste it into another place in the same PDF.
	3. Crop the user-selected part of the PDF.

What I Learned Today:

	1. Crop label by selecting the coordinates of that part which you want to crop.
	2. If you want to crop the same part every time and those coordinates are the same, then use a static cropping method in which you first find the coordinates, and after that, store those coordinates into variables and use those coordinates every time for the crop.
	3. For displaying a PDF page and selecting coordinates, use matplotlib.pyplot module. 
	4. Use numpy module for handling image arrays.
	5. PyMuPDF - for rendering PDF pages as images.
